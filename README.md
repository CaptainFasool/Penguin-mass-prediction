# Penguin-mass-prediction
Two linear regression models implemented in R that predict the mass of penguins. Both models are fit with varying features to predict the same target, and when compared for accuracy using statistical evaluation like R2 score (Coefficient of determination), model B is found to be superior due to factoring in more features. R was used as the language of choice due to its readability and placing emphasis on scientific programming, as well as the plethora of packages that it comes with, including packages for data visualisation and linear models. The language also allows for seamless statistical analysis of models, allowing for optimised model comparison. This makes small-scale model implementation and evaluation fast and simple.

To install and run the program, install R version 4.0 or higher (https://cran.r-project.org/) --> install RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) --> install relevant packages and execute code.
